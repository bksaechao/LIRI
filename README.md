# LIRI
<p>LIRI is a SIRI inspired bot that pulls data from multiple libraries and provides it to the user based on their command and inputs. While SIRI interprets voice commands, LIRI interprets text provided by the user in the node terminal application. Unfortunately since this is a command line application it cannot be easily shared for other users.</p>
